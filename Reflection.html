            The concept of resposive design is crucial part in web development. Teams that work on this make sure that the website created is<br>
            accesible to every one throught every device <b>(phone,tablet,desktop)</b> but main challenge is to create the design such that the<br>  
            content is the same across devices. RWD is a meathod which changes the appearence of the webpage based on screen size and orientation <br>
            The design uses breakpoint to find how the layout of the site should be visible. One design will be above the breakpoint and other will <br> 
            be below the point and break point determines the height width of the device for the desin to be applied. The same HTML is served to all devices <br>
            using CSS to change the appearence of the page. Instead of creating differetn HTML and CSS for different devices we can use 1 codebase for all <br> 
            devices. In RWD the content will be same but the layout grows or shrinks according the size. A three column desktop design will change to 2 column <br> 
            on a tablet to a 1 column in smartphone. Also, navigation bars can be seen in the desktop but in smart phone it will be hidden in 3 lines to open <br> 
            the navigation bar.

            Because responsive design relies on shuffling elements around the page, design and development need to work closely together to ensure a usable <br> 
            experience across devices. Responsive design often turns into solving a puzzle. However, ensuring that elements fit within a page is not enough. <br> 
            For a responsive design to be sucessfull, the design must also be usable at all screen resolutions and sizes. When elements move around the page <br>
            the user experince can be completely different from one view of the site to the next. It is important that design and development tems work together <br>
            not to just determine how the content should be shuffled around, but to also see what the end of that shift looks like and how it affects the user <br>
            experience. Many teams look for popular responsive design frameworks, such as Bootstraps to help create designs.Such frameworks can be great help in <br>
            moving development along. However, carefully consider how the framework will work with the content and functionality of the site, rather than how it works <br>
            in general.

                I have read a few websites about the importance of RWD.If we dont user it in out webpage and keep the same layout for desktop and smartphone <br>
                there will be overflow of content and horizontal scrolling because of the width difference and that anoys the user to scroll for content <br>
                specifically when reading newspapers or some online content user dosent want to scroll to the end of line and then scroll back to the start <br>
                for the begin of line. This is one of the most important feature in development of the web.

           In this course we learnt mostly about front-end development languages like JS,HTML,CSS these are the font end design main sources. Before this course <br> 
           I had knowledge about HTML and CSS and learnt a few new tricks also along with old one's. JS is all new to me I learnt so much about JS individually and also <br>
           in combination with HTML DOM or CSS. By the end of course I was able to create webpage with validation using JS and HTML5 validation.
